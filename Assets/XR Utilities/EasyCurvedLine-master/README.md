# Easy Curved Line Renderer
### Easy rendering and editing of curved lines in Unity
**Requires Unity 2017.1 or higher.**

This is a project born from the [Easy Curved Line Renderer utility](https://forum.unity.com/threads/easy-curved-line-renderer-free-utility.391219/#post-3654403) originally created by [AcrylicCode](https://github.com/AcrylicCode) and posted on the Work In Progress forum of Unity, then modified by [GPV](https://github.com/gpvigano).

[AcrylicCode](https://github.com/AcrylicCode) discovered how to easily smooth out any set of positions, thus easing the creation of some simple Curved Line Renderers.

[GPV](https://github.com/gpvigano) adapted the original project to the newer versions of Unity, making some changes and exploiting the line texturing feature added since Unity 2017.1.

**Also useful for rendering solid lines (e.g. wires, pipes, speech bubble tails...)**

*Animation in the included example scene*

## Features
Included:
* scripts:
  * LineSmoother
    * main utility script for smoothing out positions
    * static function so it can be accessed without being attached to a gameobject
    * feed it an array of Vector3 and a segment size and you will get back a smoothed out array!
    * segment size is world space and so the number of line segments in between points adjusts based on distance between points
  * CurvedLineRenderer
    * example use case for smoothed out positions
    * add new points and it will automatically update to include the new position!
    * example scene is provided with a regular curved line and a curved line with physics applied to each point
  * CurvedLinePoint
    * draws gizmo and sends back to CurvedLineRenderer to update line when the point is moved
* textures and materials:
  * normal maps to make curved lines look like their were solid
  * sample ready-to-use materials for lines (unlit and wires or pipes)

## Documentation

An example scene is provided to demonstrate different usages of the included assets.

To see how Easy Curved Line Renderer work,
see `EasyCurvedLine` example scene in `Assets/EasyCurvedLine/Examples`.

Context menus are added to Unity Editor to ease the creation of curved lines.
* In Game Object menu (and in the Hierarchy view context menu) a new `Curved line` menu item is present in `Effects` sub-menu.
* In Curved Line Renderer component there is a menu item for adding new line control points.
* In Curved Line Point component there are menu items for adding new line control points.

If you don't want this feature in your Editor you can simply delete the EasyCurvedLine/Scripts/Editor folder.

You can find the Easy Curved Line Renderer reference documentation in `Documentation` folder
both as [compressed HTML](https://github.com/gpvigano/EasyCurvedLine/blob/master/Documentation/EasyCurvedLine.chm) and [zipped HTML](https://github.com/gpvigano/EasyCurvedLine/blob/master/Documentation/EasyCurvedLine_html.zip).
